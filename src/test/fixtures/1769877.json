Red Queen dynamics provide a powerful explanation for the occurrence of sexual reproduction, i.e. as a mechanism to cope with the rapidly evolving parasites. Parasites adapt to specific and frequent host genotypes. A possible way for the host population to escape is to produce a genetically diverse set of offspring so that these also include genotypes to which the parasites are not adapted. These fast reciprocal interactions between hosts and parasites result in fluctuating frequencies of allelic variants of both host and parasite genotypes through time. These fluctuations are driven by frequency-dependent selection and do not result in a net change or steady increase in the fitness of any of the coevolving partners over time.
