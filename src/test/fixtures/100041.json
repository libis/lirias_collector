Particularly, it was investigated whether this biomarker allowed to estimate differences in the site of fermentation. Ten volunteers were included in a placebo-controlled crossover study. They consumed in random order 2 x 15 g RS/day for 2 weeks and placebo for 2 weeks separated by 2 weeks wash-out. At baseline, on the first day of each intake period and after each intake period, they consumed a (15)N-labelled test meal and collected all urine in different fractions for 48 h. In ten other volunteers, the effect of 2 x 15 g RS/day and of 2 x 15 g RS + 2 x 6 g WB was compared. These volunteers collected urine and feces for 72 h. (15)N-content of urine and feces was measured using combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. RS exerted a significant decrease in cumulative urinary (15)N-excretion which was different from placebo. The effect was most pronounced in the 6-24 h urine fraction which suggest fermentation in the proximal colon. The effect of RS+WB on cumulative urinary (15)N-excretion was not significantly different from the effect of RS. A less pronounced decrease in the 6-24 h fraction was observed suggesting less fermentation in the proximal colon whereas no indications for more distal fermentation were observed. Since about 80% of the cumulative urinary (15)N was recovered within 24 h, it was concluded that the biomarker (15)N-LU was useful to monitor processes in the proximal colon rather than in the distal colon."],"author":[{"last_name":"Cloetens","initials":"L","first_names":"Lieselotte","identifiers":{"staff_nbr":"U0047008"},"name":"Cloetens, Lieselotte","pnx_display_name":"Cloetens, Lieselotte$$QCloetens, Lieselotte"},{"last_name":"De Preter","initials":"V","first_names":"Vicky","identifiers":{"staff_nbr":"U0038376"},"name":"De Preter, Vicky","pnx_display_name":"De Preter, Vicky$$QDe Preter, Vicky"},{"last_name":"Rutgeerts","initials":"P","first_names":"Paul","identifiers":{"staff_nbr":"U0007636"},"name":"Rutgeerts, Paul","pnx_display_name":"Rutgeerts, Paul$$QRutgeerts, Paul"},{"last_name":"Verbeke","initials":"K","first_names":"Kristin","identifiers":[{"orcid":"0000-0002-5352-7565"},{"researcherid":"HMG-3711-2023"},{"staff_nbr":"U0018368"}],"name":"Verbeke, Kristin","pnx_display_name":"Verbeke, Kristin$$QVerbeke, Kristin"},{"last_name":"De Loor","initials":"J","first_names":"Jetty","identifiers":[{"orcid":"0000-0003-4421-6340"},{"researcherid":"D-3579-2018"},{"staff_nbr":"U0042293"}],"name":"De Loor, Jetty","pnx_display_name":"De Loor, Jetty$$QDe Loor, Jetty"}],"author_url":["https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000256928200006&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=ef845e08c439e550330acc77c7d2d848"],"volume":["47"],"issue":["4"],"pagination":[{"begin_page":"217","end_page":"223","pagination":"217 - 223"}],"publisher":["Steinkopff"],"publication_date":["2008-06-01"],"online_publication_date":["2008-06-16"],"acceptance_date":["2008-05-27"],"doi":["10.1007/s00394-008-0716-9"],"medium":["Print-Electronic"],"publication_status":["Published"],"article_number":["10.1007/s00394-008-0716-9"],"location":["Germany"],"journal":["European Journal of Nutrition"],"issn":["1436-6207"],"language":["eng"],"eissn":["1436-6215"],"external_identifiers":["18560788"],"peer_reviewed":["Yes - author can provide reports Yes - author can provide reports Yes - author can provide reports","Yes - author can provide reports"],"professional_oriented":["false"],"historic_collection":["Laboratory of Nephrology ;50000632","Translational Research in GastroIntestinal Disorders ;50000628"],"public_url":["https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/201716","https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/615355","https://lirias.kuleuven.be/100041"],"files":[{"filename":"Does the biomarker 15N-lactose ureide allow to estimate the site of fermentation of resistant starch.pdf","extension":"pdf","embargo_release_date":"9999-12-31","embargo_description":"No anonymous read access","file_url":"https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/498130","filePublic":false,"fileIntranet":true}],"additional_identifier":["https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-008-0716-9"],"organizational_unit":["51841970","50000050","50000598","50000625","50000628","50000600","51841971","51181999","54599288","50000698","50000632"],"source":"lirias","sourceid":"lirias","sourcerecordid":["100041"],"recordid":"lirias100041","local_field_07":["journal-article"],"ristype":["JOUR"],"first_author":{"last_name":"Cloetens","initials":"L","first_names":"Lieselotte","identifiers":{"staff_nbr":"U0047008"},"name":"Cloetens, Lieselotte","pnx_display_name":"Cloetens, Lieselotte$$QCloetens, Lieselotte"},"creator":[{"last_name":"Cloetens","initials":"L","first_names":"Lieselotte","identifiers":{"staff_nbr":"U0047008"},"name":"Cloetens, Lieselotte","pnx_display_name":"Cloetens, Lieselotte$$QCloetens, Lieselotte"},{"last_name":"De Preter","initials":"V","first_names":"Vicky","identifiers":{"staff_nbr":"U0038376"},"name":"De Preter, Vicky","pnx_display_name":"De Preter, Vicky$$QDe Preter, Vicky"},{"last_name":"Rutgeerts","initials":"P","first_names":"Paul","identifiers":{"staff_nbr":"U0007636"},"name":"Rutgeerts, Paul","pnx_display_name":"Rutgeerts, Paul$$QRutgeerts, Paul"},{"last_name":"Verbeke","initials":"K","first_names":"Kristin","identifiers":[{"orcid":"0000-0002-5352-7565"},{"researcherid":"HMG-3711-2023"},{"staff_nbr":"U0018368"}],"name":"Verbeke, Kristin","pnx_display_name":"Verbeke, Kristin$$QVerbeke, Kristin"},{"last_name":"De Loor","initials":"J","first_names":"Jetty","identifiers":[{"orcid":"0000-0003-4421-6340"},{"researcherid":"D-3579-2018"},{"staff_nbr":"U0042293"}],"name":"De Loor, Jetty","pnx_display_name":"De Loor, Jetty$$QDe Loor, Jetty"}],"facets_creator_contributor":["Cloetens, Lieselotte","De Preter, Vicky","Rutgeerts, Paul","Verbeke, Kristin","De Loor, Jetty","U0047008","U0038376","U0007636","U0018368","U0042293"],"facets_staffnr":["staffnr_U0007636","staffnr_U0018368","staffnr_U0038376","staffnr_U0042293","staffnr_U0047008"],"search_creationdate":["20080601"],"risdate":["20080601"],"search_startdate":["20080101"],"search_enddate":["20081231"],"format":["Print-Electronic"],"ispartof":["European Journal of Nutrition;
